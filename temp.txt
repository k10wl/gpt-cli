[x] fix critical bug with system prompts settings (out of bounds for completion)

[x] on empty input show message: "press enter twice to prune conversation".
    afterwards cleanup cache

[ ] allow to paste code in app <- how???

[x] display system message

[ ] add shorthands for flags

  - [x] -a -assistant <- set assistant model (system message config)

  - [x] -s -session <- chain prompts
  
  - [ ] -m -model <- select model to complete

  - [ ] -l -list <- list all available models or assistants

  - [ ] -u -update <- make request to openai to update available models

  - [ ] -debug <- debug mode. Maybe show cached or smth? not sure yet

  - [ ] -t -temperature <- set temperature for answer

  - [ ] -f -file <- reads file text content and sets that as system message

  - [x] -r -restore <- restore last session cache

[x] remove formatting from single completion (remove -> * * * * *)

[x] update config loading to ignore models

================================================================================

guess how this was accomplished

[x] research how to store API key

[x] move prompt files to `.yaml` or `.json`. To prevent rebuilding
    on prompt changes

[x] for sessions add flag `-s`

[x] make UI in session more clear, I'm getting lost in questions and
    asnwers. Make  smth like:

      ```
      ================
  
      Q: user propmpt
      A: completion

      ================

[x] NVIM support
